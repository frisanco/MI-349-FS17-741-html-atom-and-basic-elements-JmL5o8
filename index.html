<h1><strong>What is HTML and what can it do?</strong></h1>

<p>You've now created two files ending with .html and have heard
  that they're a foundation of web development, but... what exactly <em>is</em>
  HTML? Well, it's short for <strong>HyperText Markup Language,</strong> but
  that doesn't tell us very much.</p>

<p>So let's take a step back and look at HTML in context. Did you know that
  it's just one of the three languages that web browsers speak?</p>

<p>We won't work with the other two in this lesson, but we're introducing them
  all now to give you an idea of where HTML fits in and what you can (or can't)
  do with it.</p>
